			<td>Vincent and Jacque started Soft Supreme in 2005. They always wanted to start a business together, but
				they were not expecting it to be a bed-selling-company.</td>
			<td>Vincent was planing to start a web development company, when Jacque came to him with a business idea.
				Vincent loved it so much that Soft Supreme was born in that same conversation.</td>
			<td>We help the community by using our remainingsupplies and make affordable mattresses, blankets or pillows
				wich we either sponser or sell without a profit. When were a bigger company with a franchise or two we
				can contribute more. </td>

			<p>I have reviewed Soft Supreme.<br>
				I have tested out each of there beds and rate the beds<br>
				5/5 for the quality, innovation and functionality of their beds.<br>
				I spoke to each employer and due to the fact that some of them<br>
				are unprofessional I give them a 3/5 for service. I did speak to<br>
				Vincent about this and he said it is becuase they employ people<br>
				with no higher eduacation and then train them with business<br>
				expenses. The busines's vision and how they strategise is great <br>
				if I was to rate it I would give it a 5/5.<br><br>
				The overall rateing is 13/15 or 87% </p>
